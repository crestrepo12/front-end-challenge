Recreated a front-end challenge with vanilla html and css.


Live: https://crestrepo12.github.io/front-end-challenge/

Steps I used for this challenge:
* Drew out a wireframe mockup to see a how many elements were needed and which specific tags to use.
* Set up the structure of the HTML file as much as I could before styling. 
    - Divided large elements first and then divided smaller elements.
* I used CSS flexbox to space elements easily.
* Also imported google fonts into the CSS file to get the closest looking font family.
* I used the Sketch wireframe file to measure the content, margins, and padding of each element.
* The links at the top right corner are live.
